Choice of BE framework: Node, Express, Mongo. 

Justification: In my opinion, for a project of this small scale and simplicity (relative to the real world applications in companies), the tech stack would not matter too much. I chose this teck stack as its my bread and butter. 

How to run the code: 
1. Install mongosh to view contents of your database.
2. Clone the repo
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm run dev`
5. Play around using postman
6. http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signup, http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login, http://localhost:3000/api/notes/, http://localhost:3000/api/notes/ etc. 

I want to note that for the rate limit functionality, we could use Redis. As I built this from scratch, I spent around 8 hours already implementing all the CRUD functionality and implenting unit tests while adhering to good coding principles. Thank you for revieiwing this application. I would love to learn how I could improve!
